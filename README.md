## Overview
This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to predict red wine quality based on physicochemical attributes. Using the Red Wine Quality Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the project leverages three classification models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to identify the strengths and limitations of each approach.
